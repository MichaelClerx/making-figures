# Making figures with Inkscape and Matplotlib

This repo contains a bunch of tips and examples of how to make diagrams with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and plots of data or functions with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
It's split into three parts:

1. [General tips](./1-general-tips.md), along with some technical background.
2. [Making diagrams with Inkscape](./2-making-diagrams-with-inkscape.md), e.g. to visualise an experimental set-up or create a graphical abstract.
3. [Plotting data and functions with Matplotlib](./3-plotting-with-matplotlib.ipynb).

Disclaimer: 
- This is not a step-by-step guide or a "comprehensive" introduction, but just a list of tips and opinions that I've cobbled together from personal experience and a little reading.
- There is more and better technical information on both tools on line.
- There are books, and tutorials, and multi-year academic courses on graphical design and communication.
- There are not many papers that address scientific figure making directly ([says google](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=scientific+figures)).
  This is a good one: [Rolandi, Cheng, PÃ©rez-Kriz (2011) A Brief Guide to Designing Effective Figures for the Scientific Paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201102518).
