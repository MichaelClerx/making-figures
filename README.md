# Making figures with Inkscape and Matplotlib

This repo contains a bunch of tips and opinion on scientific figure making, using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for diagrams and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to plot data and functions.
It's split into three parts:

1. General tips:
   1. [Plan your figures](1-1-have-a-plan.md) (start with a sketch)
   2. [Design for papers, not for screens](1-2-design-for-papers.md) (start from a fixed width)
   3. [Use vector art where appropriate](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/1-3-vector-and-raster.ipynb)
   4. [Consciously use visual language](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/1-4-visual-language.ipynb)
   5. [Show your workings](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/1-5-show-your-workings.ipynb)
2. Making diagrams with Inkscape, e.g. to visualise an experimental set-up or create a graphical abstract.
   1. [Getting started](2-1-getting-started.md)
   2. [Shapes, colours, text, and lines](2-2-shapes-colours-lines.md)
   3. [More drawing](2-3-more-drawing.md)
   4. [Paths](2-4-paths.md)
   5. [Layout](2-5-layout.md)
   6. [Saving and exporting](2-6-save-and-export.md)
   7. [Annoyances](2-7-annoyances.md)
3. Plotting data and functions with Matplotlib

## Disclaimer

- This is not a step-by-step guide to either tool. Detailed technical information and several tutorials are already available on line.
- I am not an expert on any of this. There are books and websites and academic degrees in graphic design and communication.
- Few papers that I know of address scientific figure making directly ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=scientific+figures)), although there are loads on colours, perception, etc.
  A few interesting ones are listed below.
