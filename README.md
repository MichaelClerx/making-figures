# Making figures with Inkscape and Matplotlib

This repo contains a bunch of tips and opinion on scientific figure making, using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for diagrams and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to plot data and functions.
It's split into three parts:

1. General tips:
   1. [Plan your figures](1-1-have-a-plan.md) (start with a sketch)
   2. [Design for papers, not for screens](1-2-design-for-papers.md) (start from a fixed width)
   3. [Use vector art where appropriate](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/1-3-vector-and-raster.ipynb)
   4. [Consciously use visual language](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/1-4-visual-language.ipynb)
   5. [Show, don't tell](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/1-5-show-and-tell.ipynb)
2. Making diagrams with Inkscape, e.g. to visualise an experimental set-up or create a graphical abstract.
   1. [Getting started](2-1-getting-started.md)
   2. [Shapes, colours, positioning](2-2-shapes-colours-positioning.md)
   5. [Annoyances](2-5-annoyances.md)
3. Plotting data and functions with Matplotlib

Disclaimer: 
- This is not a step-by-step guide to either tool. Detailed technical information and several tutorials are already available on line.
- I am not an expert on any of this. There are books and websites and academic degrees in graphic design and communication.
- Few papers address scientific figure making directly ([says google](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=scientific+figures)).
  This is a good one: [Rolandi, Cheng, PÃ©rez-Kriz (2011) A Brief Guide to Designing Effective Figures for the Scientific Paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201102518).
