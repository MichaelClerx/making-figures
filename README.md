# Making figures with Inkscape and Matplotlib

This repo contains a bunch of tips and opinion on scientific figure making, using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for diagrams and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to plot data and functions.
It's split into three parts:

**General tips**
1. [Plan your figures](1-1-have-a-plan.md) (start with a sketch)
2. [Design for papers, not for screens](1-2-design-for-papers.md) (start from a fixed width)
3. [Use vector art where appropriate](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/1-3-vector-and-raster.ipynb)
4. [Consciously use visual language](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/1-4-visual-language.ipynb)
5. [Show your workings](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/1-5-show-your-workings.ipynb)

**Making diagrams with Inkscape**, e.g. to visualise an experimental set-up or create a graphical abstract.
1. [Getting started](2-1-getting-started.md)
2. [Shapes, colours, text, and lines](2-2-shapes-colours-lines.md)
3. [More drawing](2-3-more-drawing.md)
4. [Paths](2-4-paths.md)
5. [Saving and exporting](2-5-save-and-export.md)
6. [Annoyances](2-6-annoyances.md)

**Plotting data and functions with Matplotlib**
1. [Getting started](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/3-1-getting-started.ipynb)
2. [Lines and markers](https://nbviewer.org/github/MichaelClerx/making-figures/blob/main/3-2-lines-and-markers.ipynb)
3. [Axes, legends, and annotations](3-3-axes-legends-annotations.ipynb)
4. [Layout](3-4-layout.ipynb)
5. [Raster data](3-5-raster.ipynb)
6. [Neat tricks](3-6-neat-tricks.ipynb)

## Disclaimer

- This is not a step-by-step guide to either tool. Detailed technical information and several tutorials are already available on line.
- I am not an expert on any of this. There are books and websites and academic degrees in graphic design and communication.
- Few papers that I know of address scientific figure making directly ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=scientific+figures)), although there are loads on colours, perception, etc.
  A few interesting ones are listed below.
