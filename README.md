# Making figures with Inkscape and Matplotlib

This is a short guide to making scientific figures with the open source tools [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (for diagrams) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (for plots of data and functions).
It is split into three parts:

1. The [General tips](./1-general-tips.md) section provides a little technical background info and introduces a few of the general principles of figure making.
2. The section [Making diagrams with Inkscape](./2-making-diagrams-with-inkscape.md) introduces Inkscape, with a particular focus on the tools that can help you make good _diagrams_, e.g. drawings of a scientific set-up, or visual abstracts.
3. The section [Plotting data and functions with Matplotlib](./3-plotting-with-matplotlib.ipynb) gives a very quick tour of the most important functions in Matplotlib, which lets you _visualise data_, including (digitised) graphs of functions.

The goal in all three sections is not to provide a step-by-step guide, or a comprehensive overview, but just to give some pointers and to illustrate any general principles that seem to apply.
There is lots more technical information on both tools available on line, including several tutorials.

## Disclaimer

I'm not an expert on either of these tools, or on design or [visual communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_communication).
There are books out there, and tutorials, and multi-year academic courses!
There are [not many papers (google)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=scientific+figures), but a good one is: [Rolandi, Cheng, PÃ©rez-Kriz (2011) A Brief Guide to Designing Effective Figures for the Scientific Paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201102518).
