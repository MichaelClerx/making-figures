# Inkscape: More drawing

## Drawing on a grid

Using the grid lets you easily draw shapes that are similar sizes, and look "tidy", if not very artistic.

## Going off the grid

To draw more complex shapes, we can use the snapping feature.

In the example below I've drawn a plus sign on the grid, then disabled snap-to-grid before resizing and moving it.

We'll now make a 3d shape.
First, copy the plus sign and move it about a bit.
I've given the plus a white fill to hide what's behind it.

Now, make sure that snapping to "cusp nodes" is enabled, and draw a squinty rectangle connecting the two plus signs:

Do the same thing to create a "side".
I've used different stroke colours to differentiate tops and sides from the original plus.

## Distribute and align

DISTRIBUTING 3 BOXES

CENTERING TEXT IN BOX (justification!)

## Example: Drawing a kinetic scheme

- Start with letters in a reasonable font: these give you a scale!
